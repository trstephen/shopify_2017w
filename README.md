Winter 2017 Shopify Intern Challenge ⛄️💯
==========

To separate the 🌾 from the 💩, the fine folks at [shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) put forward a simple (?) task.

### The Challenge
Go to http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json?page=1. What is the total cost of all **Clock** and **Watch** products?

P.S. There are multiple pages.

### Running the solution
Install the node version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is cool and good.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:trstephen/shopify_2017w.git

cd shopify_2017w

# if nvm installed
nvm use

npm install

node index.js
```

### Dev notes
Are [here](./docs/dev_notes.md).
It's a documentation of my approach to this problem.
