Winter 2017 Shopify Intern Challenge ⛄️💯
==========

To separate the 🌾 from the 💩, the fine folks at [shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) put forward a simple (?) task.

### The Challenge
Go to http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json?page=1. What is the total cost of all **Clock** and **Watch** products?

P.S. There are multiple pages.

### Running the solution
Install the node version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is cool and good.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:trstephen/shopify_2017w.git

cd shopify_2017w

# if nvm installed
nvm use

npm install

node index.js
```

### Dev notes
Are [here](./docs/dev_notes.md).
It's a documentation of my approach to this problem.

### A warning
I'm not sure I'll be able to apply for this position.
This solution might not even be submitted.
You, curious github user, could probably submit this and get away with it.

But I might submit it.
Then things would be awkward.
